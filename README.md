# Machine learning W.O.C
This project is my submission for WOC 5.0 in the Machine Learning division.
The training data used to train the models are stored in Train_data folder
and the data on which predictions are made is stored in Test_data folder.
Also the final trained parameters for all the models are stored in .npy and .npz format under the Trained_Model_Parameters folder,so that it saves time.
